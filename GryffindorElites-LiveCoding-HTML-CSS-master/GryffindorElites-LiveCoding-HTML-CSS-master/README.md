## Building your project

Feel free to use any workflow that you feel comfortable with. Below is a suggested process, but do not feel like you need to follow these steps:

1. Initialize your project as a public repository on [GitHub](https://github.com/).

2. Configure your repository to publish your code to a web address. This will also be useful if you need some help during a challenge as you can share the URL for your project with your repo URL. There are a number of ways to do this, and we provide some recommendations below.

3. Look through the designs to start planning out how you'll tackle the project. This step is crucial to help you think ahead for CSS classes to create reusable styles.

4. Before adding any styles, structure your content with HTML. Writing your HTML first can help focus your attention on creating well-structured content.

5. Write out the base styles for your project, including general content styles, such as `font-family` and `font-size`.

6. Start adding styles to the top of the page and work down. Only move on to the next section once you're happy you've completed the area you're working on.
